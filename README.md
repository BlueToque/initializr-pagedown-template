This project is a clone of [Initializr][1] and is intended to show how [HTML5 Boilerplate][2], the Initializr framework and the [Pagedown][3] [Markdown][4] processor can be used together to create a very simple wiki-like web site that can be edited with a regular text editor, and [hosted on Google Drive][5].

If you want to read the long version of how this was developed, [go here](About.md).
