This web site was designed as an experiment on what you can do using the 
<a href="http://www.initializr.com/" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/wiki/PageDown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> and 
<a href="http://drive.google.com" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.ca/2012/11/announcing-google-drive-site-publishing.html" target="_blank">web site publishing</a>.

By combining the three elements, I've created an example web site that can be styled and edited easily using a simple text editor. The web site can also function offline in certain web browsers (Internet Explorer).

Any links on this web site that don't go to external sites are Markdown files that are stored on the server (Google Drive) and are loaded and converted to HTML dynamically in JavaScript. 

Since these Markdown files are hosted in Google Drive, I edit them using a regular text editor. Once they are saved, they sync to Drive and then they are live.
